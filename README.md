# Hand Gesture Control for Keyboard (Python OpenCV + MediaPipe)

This Python program allows you to control your keyboard using hand gestures captured from your webcam. You can use hand movements to simulate arrow key presses for controlling various applications or games.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: $ git clone https://github.com/Phurinatpha/Hand_gesture_project.git
2. Install requirement: $ pip install -r requirement.txt
3. Run the Python script file : project.py
4. The webcam will open, and you'll see a live feed with your hand movements. 
5. Move your hand in different directions to simulate arrow key presses:
   - Moving your hand left will press the left arrow key.
   - Moving your hand right will press the right arrow key.
   - Moving your hand up will press the up arrow key.
   - Moving your hand down will press the down arrow key.
5. You can quit the program by pressing 'q' on the keyboard.

## Customization

- You can adjust the sensitivity and other parameters in the Python script to better suit your hand gestures and environment.
- Modify the cooldown duration, threshold distance, and other constants as needed in the script.
